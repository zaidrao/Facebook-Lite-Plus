# DESCRIPTION 
Facebook Lite Plus is an android application which provides you a good interface to login your facebook accounts with multiple mode and some other customizations.
This app doesn't collect any of your information all information provided by you directly collected by facebook.
This app is in beta phase so maybe you can encounter with bugs and crashes.
I made this app inspired by fb plus and lite and try to make something useful for you, but I'm only person who code it, so don't expect much quality and I'm still learning android development.
#
# FEATURES
## Multimode login
- Mobile mode: This mode same as fb lite or other facebook mobile browsing applications, this mode support custom host and user-agent.
- Desktop mode: This mode provide you desktop facebook interface if you want see your profile in desktop mode, this mode doesn't support custom host and user-agent.
- Cookies mode: Yes you can login with cookies but this features is buggy not because of any code it's security of facebook. Login with cookies depends on your cookies sometime cookies contains enough information which require by facebook but nowdays facebook detect that cookies not from your device or browser same as where you extract them, if you want to login with cookies first set same user-agent of that where you extract them, so maybe you can success but I'm not fully sure you can try yourself. It also support custom host and user-agent.
##
## Extract cookies
When you open any three of one login mode you can extract cookies of your account if login.
You can extract them by clicking right top menu button.
##
## Custom Host and User-agent
- Custom host: By default host is (m.facebook.com) but you can change it from settings whatever you prefer to login your account like for free facebook you can set it (0.facebook.com) and for fb plus you can set it (m.facebook.com/home.php) . Don't put any domain other than facebook because it doesn't work.
- Custom user-agent: By default it use original user-agent of your device you can also set it from settings as your needs.
